Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection.

Genetic algorithm applied to solves the 8-queen problem?


Step 1: A random chromosome is generated using python module random 
Step 2: Fitness function  of the chromosome is to evaluate the solutions in the solution space and fitness score is done.
Step 3: Verify best fitness is not matchig to Fmax.
Step 4: crossover  process new offspring from 2 randomly selected best parents and Perform mutation process on new population 
Step 5: New chromosome added to population
Repeat Step 2 to 5 until a offspring  (solution) with Fitness value = Fmax is found
